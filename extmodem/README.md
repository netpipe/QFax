Sound card modem for Amateur Radio AX25
=======================================

By Alejandro Santos, LU4EXT / HB3YNQ. alejolp@gmail.com.

Web page (old): http://extradio.sourceforge.net/extmodem.html

This is a modem for AFSK AX25 packet (1200 bps APRS compatible). It is capable to both send and receive packets. The main feature of this program is that it is currently running three different demodulators in parallel, increasing the quality of reception. 

* The first modem is Thomas Sailer's multimon-
* The second is described by Sivan Toledo in this QEX article: http://www.tau.ac.il/~stoledo/Bib/Pubs/QEX-JulAug-2012.pdf
* The third is an experimental FSK delay line demodulator.

Therefore, the number of demodulated packets is very good.

You should at least set the PTT Port, Usually COMx on Windows and /dev/ttySX on Linux and Unix. You can run extmodem in receive-only mode by setting a dummy PTT mode with the argument --ptt-mode null.

The program prints the received packets on the screen having the -d switch.

### Testing with DTMF

Extmodem provides a DTMF decoder for testing. You can use your handheld radio to test the decoder by sending DTMF codes. You should be able to see on the screen the decoded DTMF code.

Also, using the --debugaudio switch you can see some simple statistics about the received audio.

### Selecting the sound device to use.

Using the ALSA backend you can use the --alsa-in-dev and --alsa-out-dev command line options to select specific input and output sound devices, ie, hw:1,0. This option only works with the ALSA backend, not PortAudio backend. To get a list of ALSA PCM input and output devices you can use the aplay and arecord ALSA command line utilities:

    $ arecord -L
    $ aplay -L

Use the complete line header as a device string. For example:

    $ arecord -L
    plughw:CARD=C920,DEV=0
        HD Pro Webcam C920, USB Audio
        Hardware device with all software conversions
    
    # ./extmodem --audio-backend=alsa --alsa-in-dev "plughw:CARD=C920,DEV=0"

The Portaudio backend uses by default the default sound device, which is usually the default ALSA device. To select a different PortAudio device you can first get a list of devices with the -L option:

    $ ./extmodem --audio-backend=portaudio --list-devices

Take note of the Device NUMBER and then use that number with the --pa-in-dev and --pa-out-dev options:

    $ ./extmodem --audio-backend=portaudio --pa-in-dev=44 --pa-out-dev=45

### APRX - TCP Kiss Support

Extmodem opens a TCP KISS interface running at port 6666. You can use any TCP KISS capable program to send and receive packets, ie "aprx":

    <interface>
      tcp-device 127.0.0.1 6666 KISS
      callsign LU0EXT-1
      tx-ok false
    </interface>

### AGWPE Support

You can use UI-VIEW32 with extmodem. This program supports a preliminary version of the AGWPE protocol, effectively emulating its behaviour. It opens a TCP socket on port 8000, the AGWPE default. 

### Example on the RPi

This is my command line on the Raspberry Pi. I am using an external USB sound card interface:

    ./extmodem --ptt-mode null --audio-backend alsa --alsa-in-dev "hw:1" -s 44100 --out-chan 2 --in-chan 1 --debug

Build from source
-----------------

### Linux, get the source

On your Linux terminal write:

    git clone https://github.com/alejolp/extmodem.git

The source code should be at the "extmodem" directory.

### Compile

On Linux systems you can compile with g++ using cmake. You need:

* Modern C++ compiler with C++11 support
* CMAKE
* Boost C++ library development files
* PortAudio VERSION 19 library development files

On Debian and Ubuntu you can install the required packages easily:

    apt-get install cmake build-essential g++ portaudio19-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-program-options-dev libhamlib-dev

Then just type, at the "extmodem" directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make -j4

The executable should be at  `build/extmodem`

### Raspberry Pi Support

I'm running extmodem on my RPi. To compile with cmake you can:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    CXX=$(which g++-4.8) CC=$(which gcc-4.8) CFLAGS=-O2 CXXFLAGS=-O2 cmake ..
    make -j4
