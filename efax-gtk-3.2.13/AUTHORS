PATCHES BY

    Jean-Baptiste Quenot - 

	move the test for HAVE_PTHREAD_SIGMASK which
	includes <pthread.h> after the local header files
	have been included (efax_controller.cpp, fax_list.cpp
	and mainwindow.cpp)

	store the result of gethostbyaddr() in a std::string
	to prevent static data being overwritten
	(socket_server.cpp).

    Pavel Vainerman -
	
	include an option for user files to be stored in a
	sub-directory of the $HOME directory to be specified
	in the efax-gtkrc configuration file (re-implemented
	by Chris Vine).

	add a date column to the fax lists
