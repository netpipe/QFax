"Sending faxes\n"
"-------------\n"
"\n"
"Before sending a fax, it must be specified in the \"Fax to send\" box. It "
"must be in postscript or PDF format (formats produced by all Unix/Linux word "
"and document processors), and will be converted by the program into the "
"correct tiffg3 fax format.\n"
"\n"
"There are two fax entry methods.  First, the fax to be sent can be a file "
"saved on the filesystem.  It can be entered manually in the \"Fax to send\" "
"box, or entered by means of the file selection dialog.  If the file "
"comprises a single postscript or PDF file, then you can find it by pressing "
"the \"Single File\" button.  It can be more easily found with this dialog if "
"it is placed in the $HOME/faxout directory.\n"
"\n"
"Where more than one file is specified in the \"Fax to send\" box, they will "
"be sent as a single fax appended in the order in which they are entered in "
"the box.  Such multiple files can be more easily selected using the file "
"list brought up by pressing the \"Multiple Files\" button.  Pressing the "
"\"Multiple Files\" button enables files to be found and added to the file "
"list, and they can be reordered by using the Up or Down arrow buttons, or by "
"dragging and dropping with the mouse.\n"
"\n"
"As an alternative, faxes can be received directly from the print system by "
"means of a socket server provided by the program.  Efax-gtk maintains a list "
"of queued faxes received from the socket which can be accessed by choosing "
"\"Socket\" as the fax entry method, and then bringing up the queued faxes "
"list by pressing the \"Socket list\" button.  This is a more convenient way "
"of sending faxes from a word processor, and enables a fax to be sent for "
"faxing to efax-gtk by printing from the word processor program.  Where a fax "
"is queued for sending in the socket list, a small red circle will appear in "
"the main program window on the right hand side of the \"Fax to send\" box.  "
"For particulars of how to set up CUPS or lpr/lprng to send to efax-gtk, see "
"the README file which comes with the distribution.\n"
"\n"
"The telephone number to which the fax is to be sent is entered into the "
"\"Tel number\" box.  This can be entered directly into the box, or by using "
"the built-in addressbook.  The addressbook can be invoked by pressing the "
"\"Tel number\" button, or from the `File/Address book' pull-down menu item "
"(see the \"Address Book\" tag in this help dialog). However, if a telephone "
"connection has already been established with the remote fax receiver, then "
"the fax can be sent without dialing by leaving the \"Tel number\" box blank "
"(a dialog will come up asking if you would like to send the fax without "
"dialing).\n"
"\n"
"When a fax is received from the print system via the socket server, the "
"program settings can also be configured to bring up a dialog automatically.  "
"If the program is inactive or is standing-by to receive faxes the fax can be "
"sent directly from this dialog without the need to invoke the list of queued "
"faxes received from the socket.\n"
"\n"
"Successfully sent faxes are copied to a directory in the $HOME/faxsent "
"directory, which has a name derived from the year, month, day, hour and "
"seconds when the sending of the fax was completed, and will appear in the "
"faxes sent list.  They are only included in that list if they have been sent "
"without error.  The efax message display box will report on the progress of "
"a fax being sent.  The fax list can be brought up from the `File/List sent "

"Receiving faxes\n"

"\n"
"Secondly, the program can take over a call which has already been answered "
"(say, by a telephone hand set) by pressing the \"Take over call\" button.\n"

"Thirdly, the program can be placed in standby mode by pressing the \"Standby"
"\" button.  This will automatically answer any call after the number of "

"will keep on receiving faxes until the \"Stop\" button is pressed.\n"
"\n"
"Received faxes in tiffg3 format (one file for each page) are placed in a "
"directory in the $HOME/faxin directory, which has a name derived from the "
"year, month, day, hour and seconds when reception of the fax was completed, "

"\n"
"Received faxes can be printed, viewed, described and managed using the built "
